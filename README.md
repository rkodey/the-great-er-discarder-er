This is a fork of the dormant "The Great Discarder" project, now updated with new features.<br>
No tracking.  No drama.  Only fast-*er* browsing!<br>
Full Manifest V3 support in Chrome and Edge.

<br>

**Welcome** to all users coming from "**The Marvellous Suspender**", "**The Great Suspender (notrack)**", "**Tab Suspender**", or other similar extensions!

> Is your tab "Suspender" extension showing a warning "This extension may soon no longer be supported" ?<br>

Don't risk losing your suspended tabs!<br>
This extension can migrate your existing suspended tabs,
so you won't lose them if/when Chrome removes your old unsupported extensions.

<br>

## What does "Discarding" a tab mean?
> A discarded tab is one whose content has been unloaded from memory, but is still visible in the tab strip.
> Its content is reloaded the next time it is activated.

Discarding a tab does NOT close or remove or delete the tab.
It natively tells your browser it can frees up memory and resources, and is the preferred way to keep your browser running fast and efficient.

## What about "Suspending" tabs?
Tab suspending is the old-school approach at saving memory.
Problem is, the browsers still assign resources to the suspended mini-pages.
Tab discarding was added for a reason, as it allows the browser to natively free up memory.

<br>

## What's New
see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

# Notes from the original author...

"The Great Discarder" started as a clone of another (former) open source extension "The Great Suspender".
It was built to take advantage of Chromium's 'tab discarding' functionality which is essentially a native implementation of tab suspension.
This extension is more robust and performant, both in the resources consumed by the extension, and the memory savings of the tab suspension.
It is also compatible with tab history syncing.


## Install as a local extension from source

1. Download the **[latest release](https://github.com/rkodey/the-great-er-discarder-er/releases)** and unarchive to your preferred location (whichever suits you).
2. Navigate to chrome://extensions/ and enable "Developer mode" in the upper right corner.
3. Click on the `Load unpacked extension...` button.
4. Browse to the src directory of the downloaded, un-archived release and confirm.


## Build from github

Dependencies: openssl, nodejs / npm.

Clone the repository and run these commands:
```
npm install
npm run generate-key
npm run build
```

It should say:
```
Done, without errors.
```

The extension in crx format will be inside the build/crx/ directory. You can drag it into chrome://extensions to install locally.
