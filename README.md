## What does "Discarding" a tab mean?
> A discarded tab is one whose content has been unloaded from memory, but is still visible in the tab strip.
> Its content is automatically reloaded the next time it is activated.

Discarding a tab does NOT close or remove or delete the tab.
It natively tells your browser it can frees up memory and resources, and is the preferred way to keep your browser running fast and efficient.

## What about "Suspending" tabs?
Tab suspending is the old-school approach at saving memory, **but allows for customization**.
Your browser will still assign some resources to the suspended "mini-pages" to allow for the customization.
You can also Discard a Suspended tab...  perhaps getting the best of both worlds.

## What's New

### April 2025
- **Suspending Tabs** has been added
  - You can Suspend individual tabs in addition to Discarding them, using the extension popup or keyboard shortcuts
  - You can switch between automatic Suspending and Discarding tabs in the Settings
- **Suspended Tabs** can have their tab titles customized with a prefix for setting visual distinction
  - Example prefixes: üí§ üî¥ üü° ( ... and more colors )
  - I'm considering favicon customization as well, if there's positive feedback for that
- **Migrating** tabs is awesome-*er* now that you can view and select which eligible tabs you'd like to Migrate or Convert
- **Tiny Suspender** `suspend.html` tabs can be migrated!
- Fixed tab migration to handle the different formats better, which should prevent looping

### March 2025
- **Tab Suspender** `park.html` tabs can be migrated!
- Fixed several issues ( introduced by Manifest V3 ) affecting popup and context menu actions
- **Discard at startup** was fixed to handle occasional browser startup quirks
- Rearrange the tab migration page to simplify it a bit
- Tab Groups are now ( optionally ) displayed on the Profiler page

see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for full details.

## Feature Highlights
